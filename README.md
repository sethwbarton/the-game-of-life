# TheGameOfLife

A simple version of Conway's Game of Life. 

This repository holds a place near to my heart as it was one of the first things I remember creating in the web. During my freshman year at school we had a lab
to recreate Conway's game of life, written in C, and run on a LED screen hooked up to some microcontroller. It was one of those labs that just had me enthralled
and also in tears because of how difficult it was. At some point I decided to recreate that lab (or at least some semblance of it) in the browser. This is it.
